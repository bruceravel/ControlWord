Control Word is a tile laying word game much like a particular, very
popular crossword board game, but with elements of area control and
direct player interaction.  Each player plays words using a different
color of tiles.  Points are scored by having the most tiles of your
color in a word at the end of the game.  Longer words score more
points.  The player who controls the most words and scores the most
points is the winner!

In each round, each player will play up to two words formed from a
hand of tiles.  Any tiles not used to play a word can be used to
replace your opponent's tiles, possibly allowing you to wrest away
control of that word.  From round to round, turn order will vary, as
will the number of tiles you can draw into your hand.


* Setup
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Setup
:END:

The game is played on any flat surface which is large enough to hold
about 20 side-by-side tiles in both directions.  The board from any
tile-laying word game can be used, but special spaces are ignored and
words can extend beyond the grid on the board.  It's probably easiest
to simply play right on the table.

1. Select a starting play mat.  The starting play mats are the sheets
   which depict four crossing words printed in blue.  Place this in
   the center of the table.

2. Place the rules market near the play mat, but with enough room to
   play words around the starting play mat.

3. Shuffle the rules cards.  For a two player game, remove 8 cards.
   For a three payer game, remove 4 cards.  Lay five out in the rules
   market.  Stack the rest to the side of the market.

4. Roll the 6-sided die and add 5 to the number you roll.  Place the
   die in the corresponding box above the rules market.

5. Each played claims a color of tiles.  Draw a number of tiles equal
   to the die roll plus 5 in your color.

6. Place the bags of blue vowels and blue consonants within easy reach
   of the play area.

7. Assign the first player marker to one of the players.

You are now ready to play.  The play area should look this this:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[file:images/setup.jpg]]


A {{{color(blue,penalty token)}}} is a tile taken from the bag of blue
consonants and kept beside a players rack for the remainder of the
game.  At scoring, {{{color(blue,penalty tokens)}}} count against the
score from words you control.


* Playing the game
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Playing
:END:

The first player chooses a rule card from the market.  This round will
play according to the rules written on that card.  

The first player prepares for the next round by doing:

 1. Discard the oldest rules card (the one in the #1 or #2 spot).
    Slide all rules cards to the left.  Refill the rules market from
    the stack of unused rules cards.

 2. Roll the 6-sided die, adds five and places it in the appropriate
    spot.  During this round, after playing according to the rules
    card, that person will draw tiles up to the number rolled plus
    five.

In turn order, starting with the first player, play according to the
rules stated on the rules card.  *First* do the action on the top of
the card, *then* do the action on the bottom of the card.  At the end
of each action, every word on the table *must* be an allowed word.

Most rule cards direct the player to do two action, which must be
played in the order indicated:

- Word Phase :: Play up to the number of words indicated as crossing
                words.  A "crossing word" is defined below.  In a
                round specifying two words, you may play 0, 1, or 2
                words on your turn.  In a round specifying 1 word, you
                must skip directly to the tile replacement phase.  The
                words may be of any length and you may any number of
                the tiles in front of you.
- Tile Replacement Phase :: Using tiles on your rack, replace tiles
     that have been played by other players with tiles of your color.
     In this way, you are working towards gaining control of words
     that have already been played.  In this round, you may also use
     your tiles to append a suffix or prefix to a word that has
     already been played, with the caveats that the appended tiles may
     not outnumber the tiles to be used in this phase and that the
     resulting string is an allowed word.

At the end of your turn, draw up to the number of tiles as determined
by the die roll at the beginning of the round.

Play passes to the *left*.

Once everyone has played in this round, pass the first player marker
to the *right* and begin the next round.

The final round of the game begins when the last card is drawn from
the stack of rules cards.

:CUSTOM_ID: Rulecards
:END:

Examples of rule cards:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[file:images/cards.jpg]]


In a round with the rule card on the right, each player will play 0 or
1 words using the tiles in hand.  After playing a word, up to 3 of
the remaining tiles in hand can be used to replace tiles already in
play or to append to an existing word.  In this way, a player can try
to wrest control of a word away from an opponent.  Finally, the player
draws up to a hand of 9 tiles.

In the word playing phase, the rules cards specify that 0, 1, or 2
cards can be played.  In the change/append phase, 6, 3, or 0 tiles can
be played.  In the draw phase, each player draws to a hand of 5, 7, or
9 cards.

Once each player has played according to the rules of the current
card, turn order for the next round is set.  Equally distributed among
the cards are instructions to preserve the current turn order, to
reverse the current turn order, or to reroll for turn order.  That
determines the order for the following round.

* Word Phase
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: WordPhase
:END:

A word must be an English-language word.  Players should agree upon a
dictionary to use for resolving challenges.  Proper nouns,
foreign-language words not adopted into English, acronyms, and
abbreviations are not allowed.  In short, the rules for allowable
words are the same as the popular word game that this game resembles.

A word played in this phase must be a crossing word.  Here "mundane"
is played crossing "bones", using the "N" from the existing word:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 35%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[file:images/mundane.jpg]]

In this phase, you may not simply append tiles to an existing word in
the same direction.  However, the cross can be a letter appended to a
word.  For example, the "s" in "music" can be used to pluralize a word
in the opposite direction, as in this example where the word "bone" is
pluralized:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 35%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[file:images/music.jpg]]

The word "quit" in this example is a legal play, as both "pi" and "it"
count as crossing words:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[file:images/picnic_quit.jpg]]

Appending "back" to "paper", as in

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[file:images/paperback.jpg]]

is not a legal play in the word phase.  This is different from that
other popular crossword game.  Note, however, that this might be an
excellent play in the tile replacement phase.

* Tile Replacement Phase
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: TileReplacementPhase
:END:

In the tile replacement phase, individual tiles are used to replace
tiles in a word in play.  Tiles can also be appended to the beginning
or end of another word to make a new word.

This phase is used to take control of words from your opponent.

** Changing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Changing
:END:

Changing tiles is the main tactic for wresting control of a word.  By
changing enough tiles from your opponent's color to your color, you
can gain control of your opponent's word.  A same-letter swap is most
common, but a letter can be replaced with a different letter so long
as the word and any crossing words remain valid dictionary words.

In this example, white has changed a black "R" to a white "R":

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[file:images/change.jpg]]

Three more changes and white will control the word!

The letter need not be replaced with the same letter so long as the
resulting word is allowed.  As an example, the word "marking" can be
changed to "parking" by changing the "m" of one color to a "p" of
another color.

When changing a tile, discard the tile being removed from the board.
Do not put it back in its bag.

Blue tiles can be changed.  Doing so can allow a player to seize
control of a blue word!

To replace words from the tableau on the starting play mat, simply
place a tile in your color /on top of/ the corresponding letter on the
starting play mat.

** Appending
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Appending
:END:

In the tile replacement phase, you can also append tiles to existing
words as prefix or suffix, for example to make make a plural or to add
a verb conjugation.  In this example, black has added a "Y" to the
"grocer":

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[file:images/grocery.jpg]]


Several letters can be appended as part of the same play, as in the
example of "paperback" above, so long as the number of tiles on the
rule card is observed and the word is allowable once all tiles are
placed.

* Blue vowels and consonants

At any time, as a free action, you may replace a tile from your rack
with a tile from the bag of blue vowel or the bag of blue consonants.
Simply return one of your tiles to your bag (it is *not* discarded)
and draw a tile from one of the blue bags.  You may repeat this free
action any number of times.

Using the blue tiles in this way can help repair a rack lacking either
vowels or consonants, allowing you to play a longer, more valuable
word.  The drawback is that the word you play will have fewer tiles of
your color, weakening your control over the word.

The only way to remove a blue tile from your rack is to play it in a
word.  You *may not* return a blue tile to its bag.

* Replacing a hand
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Replacing
:END:

At the beginning of your turn, you can opt to return your entire hand
of tiles to your bag.  Shake the bag to mix the tiles, redraw to 2
less than the current hand, then proceed with your turn, then return
your old tiles to the bag.  If you are still unsatisfied with your
rack, you may redraw as many times as you like to that same number of
tiles, but each subsequent draw costs two {{{color(blue,penalty
tokens)}}}.


* Challenging a word
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Challenging
:END:

Any word played in phase 1 or phase 2 can be challenged.  The
challenge is resolved using a dictionary agreeable to all players.  If
the challenged word is allowable, play continues.  If the challenged
word is not allowable, the player who played the word must withdraw
the tiles played (resetting any changed tiles) and take one
{{{color(blue,penalty token)}}}.  That player does not loose a turn
and may make a different play immediately.

* Removal cards
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Removal_Cards
:END:

There are /two/ removal cards in the game.  These work a bit
differently from the rest of the rule cards.  When the first player
selects a removal card as the rule for the round, each player will
will choose a word on the board and remove all tiles from that word
that are *not* part of a crossing word.  The word can be one that is
controlled by any player, including the person doing the removal.

For example, the word "great" can be removed by taking the "R", "E",
and "T" tiles:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[file:images/great.jpg]]

This cannot be done in a way that splits the board, leaving two or
more unconnected areas on the table.

The tiles removed are then used in the manner of the tile replacement
phase of a normal turn.  They can be used to change other tiles or
append to other words.

For each tile cannot be used elsewhere on the board, take a
{{{color(blue,penalty token)}}} for each unused tile.

* Scoring words
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Scoring
:END:

Words are scored at the end of the game. 

 * The player with the most tiles (simple plurality) in a word wins
   that word.  Some examples: A five letter word requires that three
   letters be of one color in order to claim that word.  Here, white
   controls the word and receives {{{hl([3|5])}}} points:

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
   [[file:images/plurality5.jpg]]

   A seven letter word can be claimed by black if three tiles are
   black, two are white, and two have remained blue.  Here, black
   controls the word and receives {{{hl([8|14])}}} points:

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
   [[file:images/plurality7.jpg]]

 * Any word for which the blue tiles are the simple plurality does not
   score for any player.

 * Any word for for which two (or more) colors are tied for the most
   tiles does not score for any player.

Long words are rewarded.  Use the chart below for scoring.

|          12 |              89 |              54 |


Each J, Q, X, or Z in a word scores a {{{hl(3 point)}}} bonus for the
player controlling that word.

* End of game
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: End_of_game
:END:

The last round begins when the final card is drawn from the reserve
pile of rule cards.  Each player plays according to the rule
chosen,then proceed to final scoring.

Score each word on the board according the rules above.

Each {{{color(blue,penalty token)}}} counts for -5 points.

Highest score wins.  Most words controlled is the first tie-breaker.
Fewest {{{color(blue,penalty tokens)}}} is second tie-breaker.

Here's the end game at the end of the first play test of Control Word!
