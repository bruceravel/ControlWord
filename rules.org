Control Word is a tile laying word game much like a particular, very
popular crossword board game, but with elements of area control and
direct player interaction.  Each player plays words using a different
color of tiles.  Points are scored by having the most tiles of your
color in a word at the end of the game.  Longer words score more
points.  The player who controls the most words and scores the most
points is the winner!

In each round, each player will play a word formed from a rack of
tiles.  Any tiles not used to play a word can be used to replace your
opponent's tiles, possibly allowing you to wrest away control of that
word.

From round to round, turn order will vary, as will the number
of tiles you can draw into your hand.

* Components

:CUSTOM_ID: Components
:END:

- Bags containing 98 letter tiles (i.e. a standard 100-letter tile set
  with the blank tiles removed) in four player colors (black, white,
  red, green) and one non-player color (blue).

- 6 starting play mats, each containing four crossing words in blue.

- 1 die with faces 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9.



* Setup
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Setup
:END:

The game is played on any flat surface which is large enough to hold
about 20 side-by-side tiles in both directions.  The board from any
tile-laying word game can be used, but special spaces are ignored and
words can extend beyond the grid on the board.  It's probably easiest
to simply play right on the table.

1. Select a starting play mat.  The starting play mats are the sheets
   which depict four crossing words printed in blue.  Place this in
   the center of the table.

2. Roll the 6-sided die.  Each player will draw a number of tiles
   equal to the number rolled.

3. Each player claims a color of tiles.  Draw a number of tiles equal
   to the die roll.

4. Place the bags of blue vowels and blue consonants within easy reach
   of the play area.

5. Each player draws a tile from the bag.  The lowest (closest to A)
   letter is the first player.  Return these tiles to the bag and give
   the first player token to the first player.


{{{hl(How many rounds?)}}}  Maybe make a round counter mat.  Move the
draw die forward each round....


#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Market setup

1. Roll the 6-sided die and add 5 to the number you roll.  Place the
   die in the corresponding box above the rules market.

2. Place the rules market near the play mat, but with enough room to
   play words around the starting play mat.

3. Shuffle the rules cards.  For a two player game, remove 8 cards.
   For a three payer game, remove 4 cards.  Lay five out in the rules
   market.  Stack the rest to the side of the market.

You are now ready to play.  The play area should look like this:

** Vocabulary

- A {{{tile(blue,penalty token)}}} is a tile taken from the bag of
  blue consonants and kept face down beside a players rack for the
  remainder of the game.  At scoring, {{{tile(blue,penalty tokens)}}}
  count against the score from words you control.

- A play mat shows the starting words for the game.  At the beginning
  of the game, the starting words are completely controlled by the
  blue non-player.  Control of these blue words can be seized during
  the replacement phase. 

- *Plurality control* of a word: having the most tiles in a word of your
  color while having less than 50% of the letters.  For example, green
  has plurality of a 7 letter word when 3 letters are green, 2 letters
  are black, and two letters are red, e.g.:

  {{{tile(green,B)}}}{{{tile(black,A)}}}{{{tile(green,N)}}}{{{tile(green,A)}}}{{{tile(black,N)}}}{{{tile(darkred,A)}}}{{{tile(darkred,S)}}}

- *Majority control* of a word: having more than 50% of the tiles in a
  word in your color.  For example, green has majority control of a
  7 letter word when 4 of the tiles are green, e.g.:

  {{{tile(green,A)}}}{{{tile(blue,G)}}}{{{tile(green,A)}}}{{{tile(green,I)}}}{{{tile(black,N)}}}{{{tile(darkred,S)}}}{{{tile(green,T)}}}

* Playing the game
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Playing
:END:

** Roll phase

The die is rolled.  The number that comes up is the number of tiles
that each player will draw to at the end of the round.  /Round
counter.../

** Word phase

Starting with the first player and proceeding to the left, each player
plays a word using any number of tiles from the rack.

A word must be an English-language word.  Players should agree upon a
dictionary to use for resolving challenges.  Proper nouns,
foreign-language words not adopted into English, acronyms, and
abbreviations are not allowed.  In short, the rules for allowable
words are the same as the popular word game that this game resembles.

Word placement rules from that other crossword game apply.  New words
are formed by 

- Adding one or more letters to a word or letters already on the
  board.
- Placing a word at right angles to a word already on the board. The
  new word must use one of the letters already on the board or must
  add a letter to it.
- Placing a complete word parallel to a word already played so that
  adjacent letters also form complete words.

Note the scoring chart below.  Unlike other word games, each letter is
of equal value.  Longer words score more points.  2 and 3 letter words
score no points.  (2 and 3 letter words do score the bonus for the
letters J, Q, X, and Z and can be controlled by a player for the
purpose of the end-of-game tie-breaker.)

** Replacement phase

After the word phase, the starting player begins the replacement
phase.  Passing to the left, all players take their replacement phase
actions.

/{{{hl(Start with the last player and pass to the right?)}}}/

Using any remaining tiles from the rack, replace other tiles on the
board.  These can be tiles in other player colors or any blue tiles --
including the spaces on the starting word mat.

More than one tile in a word can be replaced in a turn, however all
words must still be words at the end of each player's turn.

The simplest replacement phase action is to replace a letter of a
different color with the same letter of your color.  Replacing a
letter with a different letter is allowed, but the newly formed word
must be in the dictionary.  As an example "playing" can be changed to
"praying" by replacing the "l" with an "r" of your color.

Multiple letters can be replaced in the same word.  If one or more of
those replacements are of different letters, the word must still be a
word at the end of your turn.  For example, "repast" can be turned
into "repent" by replacing "as" with "en" of your color.

If the replaced tile is a crossing tile, i.e. it is part of two words
which cross at that point, both words must be valid words after the
replacement. 

Replaced tiles are discarded (*not* returned to the bag).


 


* Blue vowels and consonants

At any time, as a free action, you may replace a tile from your rack
with a tile from the bag of blue vowel or the bag of blue consonants.
Simply return one of your tiles to your bag (it is *not* discarded)
and draw a tile from one of the blue bags.  You may repeat this free
action any number of times.

Using the blue tiles in this way can help repair a rack lacking either
vowels or consonants, allowing you to play a longer, more valuable
word.  The drawback is that the word you play will have fewer tiles of
your color, weakening your control over the word.

The only way to remove a blue tile from your rack is to play it in a
word.  You *may not* return a blue tile to its bag.

* Replacing a hand
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Replacing
:END:

At the beginning of your turn, you can opt to return your entire rack
of tiles -- except for any blue tiles on your rack -- to your bag.
Shake the bag to mix the tiles, redraw to 2 less than the current rack
limit, then proceed with your turn.  If you are still unsatisfied with
your rack, you may redraw as many times as you like to that same
number of tiles, but each subsequent draw costs {{{hl(one/two)}}}
{{{tile(blue,penalty tokens)}}}.


* Challenging a word
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Challenging
:END:

Any word played in phase 1 or phase 2 can be challenged.  The
challenge is resolved using a dictionary agreeable to all players.  If
the challenged word is allowable, play continues.  If the challenged
word is not allowable, the player who played the word must withdraw
the tiles played (resetting any changed tiles) and take one
{{{tile(blue,penalty token)}}}.  That player does not loose a turn
and may make a different play immediately.


* Scoring words
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Scoring
:END:

When a word is played, that player scores immediately based on the
length of the word, as given in the table below.

At the end of the game:

 * The player with the most tiles (simple plurality) in a word wins
   that word.  Some examples: A five letter word requires that three
   letters be of one color in order to claim that word.  Here, white
   controls the word and receives {{{hl([3|5])}}} points:

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
   [[file:images/plurality5.jpg]]

   A seven letter word can be claimed by black if three tiles are
   black, two are white, and two have remained blue.  Here, black
   controls the word and receives {{{hl([8|14])}}} points:

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
   [[file:images/plurality7.jpg]]


 * Any word for which the blue tiles have plurality or majority
   control does not score for any player.

 * Any word for for which two (or more) colors (including blue) are
   tied for the most tiles does not score for any player.

 * Controlling 1/2 the letters of an even-length word counts as
   majority.  For example, green has majority of this 6 letter word:

   {{{tile(green,S)}}}{{{tile(black,T)}}}{{{tile(green,A)}}}{{{tile(green,R)}}}{{{tile(black,T)}}}{{{tile(darkred,S)}}}

Long words are rewarded.  Use the chart below for scoring.

* Scoring chart
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Scoring_chart
:END:

When a word is played it scores immediately according to the "When
played" column.

End game scoring depends upon whether a player controls a plurality or
majority of letters in the word.

| word length | When played | End game plurality | End game majority |
|-------------+-------------+--------------------+-------------------|
|           2 |           0 |                  0 |                 0 |
|           3 |           0 |                  0 |                 0 |
|           4 |           1 |                  2 |                 3 |
|           5 |           2 |                  4 |                 6 |
|           6 |           4 |                  8 |                12 |
|           7 |           7 |                 14 |                21 |
|           8 |          11 |                 22 |                33 |
|           9 |          16 |                 32 |                48 |
|          10 |          22 |                 44 |                66 |
|          11 |          29 |                 58 |                87 |
|          12 |          37 |                 74 |               111 |
#+TBLFM: $2=(($1-3)**2-($1-3)+2)/2
#+TBLFM: @2$2..@3$2=0
#+TBLFM: $3=$2*2
#+TBLFM: $4=$2*3


Formula: 

Word length = 2 or 3 gets 0 points.  For word length 4+:
 - n = word length
 - x = n-3
 - in-game score = (x^2 - x + 2) / 2
 - plurality = in-game * 2
 - majority  = in-game * 3

Each J, Q, X, or Z in a word scores a {{{hl(2 point)}}} bonus for the
player playing that word.  This bonus is scored even for 2 or 3 letter
words (which would otherwise score 0 points).

* End of game
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: End_of_game
:END:

The game ends after {{{hl(How many rounds?)}}}.

Score each word on the board according the rules above, awarding
{{{hl(4 bonus point)}}} bonus for each J, Q, X, or Z to the person
controlling that word.

Each {{{tile(blue,penalty token)}}} counts for {{{hl(-5 points)}}}.

Highest score wins.  Fewest {{{tile(blue,penalty tokens)}}} is the
first tie-breaker.  Most words controlled is the second tie-breaker.

Here's the end game at the end of the first play test of Control Word!
