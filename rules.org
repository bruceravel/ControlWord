Control Word is a tile laying word game much like a particular, very
popular crossword board game, but with elements of area control and
direct player interaction.  Each player plays words using a different
color of tiles.  Points are scored by having the most tiles of your
color in a word at the end of the game.  Longer words score more
points.  The player who controls the most words and scores the most
points is the winner!

In each round, each player will play up to two words formed from a
hand of tiles.  Any tiles not used to play a word can be used to
replace your opponent's tiles, possibly allowing you to wrest away
control of that word.  From round to round, turn order will vary, as
will the number of tiles you can draw into your hand.

1. Determine how many rounds you wish to play.
2. Shuffle the rules deck and select 1 fewer rule cards than the
   number of rounds.  E.g. for a 10-round game, select 9 rule cards.
3. Shuffle the removal deck and place one removal card in the second
   half of the rules pile.  For a 10-round game, the removal card
   should be placed somewhere after the fifth card.
4. Roll for initial turn order.
5. Each player draws 10 blue tiles and chooses 7 to keep.

* Begin the game
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Begin
:END:

In turn order, play a word using the hand of blue tiles, then draw
back up to 7 blue tiles.  Each player plays two words using the blue
tiles.

Then, each player discards any remaining blue tiles back to the blue
bag and draws 7 tiles in the player's color.

The blue tiles will no longer be used to form word.  For the remainder
of the game, the blue tiles are used as *penalty tokens*.

Finally, reveal the top rule card.

* Playing the game
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Playing
:END:

Players play in turn order.  In the first round, use the same turn
order as during the beginning, blue tile round.

For each player, the round consists of three phases:

- Phase 1 :: Play up to the number of words at the top of the rule
     card.  In a round with 2 words, the player can choose to play 0
     or 1 words.  In a round with 1 word, the player can choose not to
     play a word.
- Phase 2 :: Using tiles remaining after playing in phase 1, change or
     append up to the specified number of tiles.  See the rules below
     for changing or appending.  Fewer than the specified number of
     tiles can be used in this phase with no penalty.
- Phase 3 :: Draw up (or discard down) to the number of tiles
     specified on the rule card.

Once each player has played, set the turn order for the next round
according to the bottom text of the rule card and proceed to the next
round.  Once all rule tiles have been played, the game ends and
scoring is determined.

* Rule cards
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Rulecards
:END:

Examples of rule cards:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm
[[file:images/cards.jpg]]


In a round with the rule card on the right, each player will play 0 or
1 words using the tiles in hand.  After playing a words, up to 3 of
the remaining tiles in hand can be used to replace tiles already in
play or to append to an existing word.  In this way, a player can try
to wrest control of a word away from an opponent.  Finally, the player
draws up to a hand of 9 tiles.

In the word playing phase, the rules cards specify that 0, 1, or 2
cards can be played.  In the change/append phase, 6, 3, or 0 tiles can
be played.  In the draw phase, each player draws to a hand of 5, 7, or
9 cards.

Once each player has played according to the rules of the current
card, turn order for the next round is set.  Equally distributed among
the cards are instructions to preserve the current turn order, to
reverse the current turn order, or to reroll for turn order.  That
determines the order for the following round.

* Phase 1: Playing a word
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Phase1
:END:

A word must be an English-language word.  Players should agree upon a
dictionary to use for resolving challenges.  Proper nouns,
foreign-language words not adopted into English, acronyms, and
abbreviations are not allowed.  In short, the rules for allowable
words are the same as the popular word game that this game resembles.

A word must be played as a crossing word.  Here "mundane" is
played crossing "bones":

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 35%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm
[[file:images/mundane.jpg]]

In this phase, you may not simply append tiles to an existing word in
the same direction.  However, the cross can be a letter appended to a
word.  For example, the "s" in "music" can be used to pluralize a word
in the opposite direction, as in this example where the word "bone" is
pluralized:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 35%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm
[[file:images/music.jpg]]

The word "quit" in this example is a legal play, as both "pi" and "it"
count as crossing words:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm
[[file:images/picnic_quit.jpg]]

Appending "back" to "paper", as in

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm
[[file:images/paperback.jpg]]

is not a legal first phase play.  This is different from that other
popular crossword game.  Note, however, that this would be an
excellent play in the second phase.

* Phase 2: Change/append tiles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Phase2
:END:

In the second phase, individual tiles are used to replace tiles in a
word in play.  Tiles can also be appended to the beginning or end of
another word to make a new word.

This phase is used to take control of words from your opponent.

** Changing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Changing
:END:

Changing tiles is the main tactic for wresting control of a word.  By
changing enough tiles from your opponent's color to you color, you can
gain control of your opponent's word.  A letter-for-letter swap is
quite common, but a letter can be replaced with a different letter so
long as the word and any crossing words remain valid dictionary words.

In this example, white has changed a black "R" to a white "R":

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm
[[file:images/change.jpg]]

Three more changes and white will control the word!

The letter need not be replaced with the same letter so long as the
resulting word is allowed.  As an example, the word "marking" can be
changed to "parking" by changing the "m" of one color to a "p" of
another color.

When changing a tile, discard the tile being removed from the board.
Do not put it back in its bag.

** Appending
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Appending
:END:

In the second phase, you can also append tiles to existing words, for
example to make make a plural or to add a verb conjugation.  In this
example, black has added a "Y" to the "grocer":

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm
[[file:images/grocery.jpg]]


Several letters can be appended as part of the same play, as in the
example of "paperback" above, so long as the number of tiles on the
rule card is observed and the word is allowable once all tiles are
played.

* TODO Replacing a hand
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Replacing
:END:

At the beginning of you turn, you can opt to return your hand of tiles
to your bag and redraw to 2 less than the current hand.  So, draw back
to 7 in a round with 9 tiles, to 5 in a round with 7, or to 3 in a
round with 5.  Take one *penalty token*, then proceed with your turn.
You may redraw as many times as you like, but each subsequent draw
costs two *penalty tokens*.

* Challenging a word
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Challenging
:END:

Any word played in phase 1 or phase 2 can be challenged.  The
challenge is resolved using a dictionary agreeable to all players.  If
the challenged word is allowable, play continues.  If the challenged
word is not allowable, the player who played the word must withdraw
the tiles played (resetting any changed tiles) and take one *penalty
token*.  That player does not loose a turn and may make a different
play immediately.

* Removal cards
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Removal_Cards
:END:

In one of the later rounds, a removal card will be drawn as the rule
card.  

When this happens, each player (in the turn order determined from the
previous rule card) will choose a word on the board and remove all
tiles that are not part of a crossing word.  The word can be one that
is controlled by any player, including the person doing the removal.

For example, the word "great" can be removed by taking the "R", "E",
and "T" tiles:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm
[[file:images/great.jpg]]

This cannot be done in a way that splits the board, leaving two or
more unconnected areas on the board.

The tiles removed are then used in the manner of phase 2 of a normal
turn.  They can be used to change other tiles or append to other
words.

For each tile cannot be used elsewhere on the board, take a *penalty
token* for each unused tile.

* Scoring words
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Scoring
:END:

Words are scored at the end of the game. 

 * The player with the most tiles (simple plurality) in a word wins
   that word.  Some examples: A five letter word requires that three
   letters be of one color in order to claim that word.  Here, white
   controls the word and receives /[3|5]/ points:

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm
   [[file:images/plurality5.jpg]]

   A seven letter word can be claimed by black if three tiles are
   black, two are white, and two have remained blue.  Here, black
   controls the word and receives /[8|14]/ points:

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm
   [[file:images/plurality7.jpg]]

 * Any word for which the blue tiles are the simple plurality does not
   score for any player.

 * Any word for for which two (or more) colors are tied for the most
   tiles does not score for any player.

Long words are rewarded.  Use the chart below for scoring.

* TODO Scoring chart
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Scoring_chart
:END:

Scoring is a work in progress.  The two tracks are possible scoring
schemes.

| word length | Fibonacci track | Geometric track |
|-------------+-----------------+-----------------|
|           2 |               1 |               1 |
|           3 |               1 |               1 |
|           4 |               2 |               2 |
|           5 |               3 |               5 |
|           6 |               5 |               9 |
|           7 |               8 |              14 |
|           8 |              13 |              20 |
|           9 |              21 |              27 |
|          10 |              34 |              35 |
|          11 |              55 |              44 |
|          12 |              89 |              54 |


Each J, Q, X, or Z in a word scores a 3 point bonus for the player
controlling that word.

* End of game
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: End_of_game
:END:

The game ends when the last rule card is played.  Score each word on
the board according the rules above.

Each *penalty token* counts for -3 points.

Highest score wins.  Most words controlled is the first tie-breaker.
Fewest penalty token is second tie-breaker.
