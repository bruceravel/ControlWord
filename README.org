* Control Word

A tile-laying word game with elements of area control and direct
player interaction.


- Rules :: [[rules.org]]

- Cards :: The SVG files, created using [[https://inkscape.org][Inkscape]], are printed (perhaps
     after converting to PDF) and used for game play

- Styling :: There are various CSS and latex files used to convert the
     rules into a nice printable PDF file or an HTML page

- Build script :: The [[make_game.sh]] file is a simple shell script which
     uses [[https://inkscape.org][Inkscape]], [[https://github.com/fniessen/orgmk][orgmk]], and pdflatex to make printable PDF files
     used in the game.

To play the game, you will also need at least three different colors
of latter tiles, for example [[https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=scrabble%20tiles][here are some possible choices]].
