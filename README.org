* Control Word

A tile-laying word game with elements of area control and direct
player interaction.


- Rules :: [[rules.org]]

- Cards :: The SVG files, created using [[https://inkscape.org][Inkscape]], are printed (perhaps
     after converting to PDF) and used for game play

- Styling :: There are various CSS and latex files used to convert the
     rules into a nice printable PDF file or an HTML page

- Build script :: The [[make_game.sh]] file is a simple shell script which
     uses [[https://inkscape.org][Inkscape]], [[https://github.com/fniessen/orgmk][orgmk]], and pdflatex to make printable PDF files
     used in the game.

To make the game, print 2 copies of [[1word.svg]], and one copy each of
[[0words.svg]], [[2words.svg]], and [[remove.svg]].  Cut out the cards.  Use the
four sheets of word cards to make the main rules deck.  These will be
shuffled together and dealt to make the rules deck.  The cards from
[[remove.svg]] are used to make the small deck of removal cards, which is
shuffled before selecting one removal card to add to the rules deck.

To play the game, you will also need at least three different colors
of latter tiles, for example [[https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=scrabble%20tiles][here are some possible choices]].

The game can be played on any flat surface which is large enough to
hold about 20 side-by-side tiles in both directions.
