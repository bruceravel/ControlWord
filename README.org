* Control Word

A tile-laying word game with elements of area control and direct
player interaction.


- Rules :: [[rules.org]]

- Start mats :: The SVG files, created using [[https://inkscape.org][Inkscape]], are printed
                (perhaps after converting to PDF) and used for game
                play

- Styling :: There are various CSS and latex files used to convert the
             rules into a nice printable PDF file or an HTML page

- Build script :: The [[make_game.sh]] file is a simple shell script which
                  uses [[https://inkscape.org][Inkscape]], [[https://github.com/fniessen/orgmk][orgmk]], and pdflatex to make printable
                  PDF files used in the game.

To make the game, print copies of the starting player mats and a copy
of the rules.

To play the game, you will also need at least three different colors
of letter tiles, for example [[https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=scrabble%20tiles][here are some possible choices]], one of
which should be blue.

You will also need two 6 sided dice.  The game uses specially-valued
dice.  For the draw die, interpret the sides of a normal D6 like so:

| If you roll | use this value |
|-------------+----------------|
|           1 |              6 |
|           2 |              7 |
|           3 |              7 |
|           4 |              7 |
|           5 |              8 |
|           6 |              9 |

For the replacement limit die, interpret the sides of a normal D6 like so:

| If you roll | use this value |
|-------------+----------------|
|           1 |              2 |
|           2 |              3 |
|           3 |              3 |
|           4 |              4 |
|           5 |              4 |
|           6 |              5 |

The game can be played on any flat surface which is large enough to
hold about 20 side-by-side tiles in both directions.
